# Instance structure
We mainly uses two types of instances with suffixes `.ceop` and `.tddp`. Because these two types of instances come from the original CETSP dataset, we follow a similar file structure as the CETSP dataset. Specifically, for `.ceop` instances, we have the following file structure:

| Xs | Ys | Zs (not used) | radius | prize |
|----|----|---------------|--------|-------|

For `.tddp` instances, we have the following file structure:

| Xs | Ys | Zs (not used) | radius | prize | parcel weight impact factor |
|----|----|---------------|--------|-----------------------------|-------|

Note that `.sop` instances are the same with `.ceop` instances.
